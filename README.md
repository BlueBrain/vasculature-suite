**A lightweight, interactive, extensible and cross-platform framework for building, visualizing and analyzing vasculature (or blood vessels) morphologies.**

VessMorphoVis is an integrated suite of toolboxes for interactive visualization and analysis of vast brain vascular networks represented by 
morphological graphs segmented originally from imaging or microscopy stacks. Our workflow leverages the outstanding potentials of Blender, 
aiming to establish an integrated, extensible and domain-specific framework capable of interactive visualization, analysis, repair, 
high-fidelity meshing and high-quality rendering of vascular morphologies. VessMorphoVis is developed as an extension to its sister NeuroMorphoVis.
